# TaleKit

TaleKit contains a working **packet based*** system for creating NosTale bot, tools etc...  
This project is useless as is since it's just some kind of abstraction of the game.

## Project implementing TaleKit

- TaleKit.Spark (CLIENTLESS) [PRIVATE]
- TaleKit.Storm (LOCAL) [PRIVATE]
- TaleKit.Phoenix (LOCAL USING PHOENIX BOT API) [PUBLIC]
